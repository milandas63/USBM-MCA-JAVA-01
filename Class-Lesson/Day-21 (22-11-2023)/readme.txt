=   ABSTRACTION	ENCAPSULATION
    1.	Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information.
        While encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.
    2.	In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.
        While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.
    3.	Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information.
        Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit 
        along with a method to protect information from the outside.
    4.	We can implement abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.
        Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, 
        protected and public.
    5.	In abstraction, implementation complexities are hidden using abstract classes 
        and interfaces.
        While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.
    6.	The objects that help to perform abstraction are encapsulated.
        Whereas the objects that result in encapsulation need not be abstracted.
